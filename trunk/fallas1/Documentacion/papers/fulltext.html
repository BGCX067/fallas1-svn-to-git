invention relates to a device and to a system. More specifically, this
invention relates to a tennis ball machine wherein the tennis ball
delivery and trajectory are simulated by a series of lights or
indicators mounted on the console of the ball machine. The sequencing
of illumination of this series of indicators simulates the ball
trajectory from the time the ball is served (leaves the racket of the
opponent), and crosses the net, and bounces to the player.<br><br>2. Background of Invention<br><br>Automatic
ball hurling machines have been used in various sports for a number of
years. Baseball throwing machines have been designed which simulate
various types of pitches (e.g. curve ball, slider, fast ball, etc.), by
simulating the speed and spin imparted to the baseball. Tennis ball
hurling machines operate in a similar fashion and typically deliver a
ball from the opposite side of the net to an awaiting player. In the
typical tennis environment, the receiving player thus follows the ball
trajectory from the time the ball leaves the ball machine and travels
over the net, to position himself to strike the ball so as to permit
striking the ball and returning it over the net. The tennis ball
machine can be pre-set or programmed in accordance with a varied ball
delivery routine. For example, the ball machine can provide for an
oscillating delivery, to allow for practice of a forehand and backhand
stroke. Similarly, some ball machines can apply top-spin to the
delivered ball, thereby making the ball more difficult to return. In
each circumstance, the tennis ball machine contemplates use of a full
size tennis court to accommodate the delivery and return of the tennis
ball. In order to reduce the area (land) required to conduct such
practice, various simulators have been developed to accommodate the
more limited space constraints in urban and home environments.<br><br>The
following US patents are representative of the simulators that have
been conceived to address some of the limitations of traditional tennis
training environments.<br><br>U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,245 (to Augustine,
Jr., et al. issued Nov. 2, 1976) describes a tennis environment and
system that utilizes a practice environment this is somewhat smaller
than a full size tennis court. The system associated with the Augustine
environment simulates the service of a tennis ball, and the return from
the player on the opposite side of the net. The Augustine system also
provides for recovery of the ball for re-use by the ball machine.<br><br>U.S.
Pat. No. 4,702,475 (to Elstein et al, issued Oct. 27, 475) describes a
device and system for accelerated reaction training of a tennis student
utilizing an array of lights positioned within the field of view of the
student to prompt a different reaction or movement by the student to a
simulated trajectory of a tennis ball. More specifically, each of the
lights within the array is pre-programmed to simulate a reaction drill
and a "virtual" ground stroke, and thereby prompt a student to react to
a different tennis ball trajectory relative to a service position on
the opposite side of the tennis net. The Elstein et al, system is
described independent of an automated ball service machine; and, it is
not clear if the Elstein et al, system can be adapted to a realistic
training environment wherein the student is required to return service.<br><br>In
each of the representative systems described above, the physical
environment and the simulation of the delivery of the tennis ball,
generally contemplates an essentially full size tennis court
environment. Notwithstanding the relative advantages of each, both
require a relatively large practice environment, and separate and
distinct practice drills to improve reaction time and ground stroke
technique. Accordingly, there continues to exist the need to combine
the advantages of each, and to yet afford such advantages within the
urban and home environment settings that are constrained by the
physical limitation inherent in such environments.<br><br>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br><br>It is the object of this invention to remedy the above as well as related deficiencies in the prior art.<br><br>More
specifically, it is the principal object of this invention to provide a
tennis training simulation system that improves both reaction time and
ground stroke techniques within a limited physical training environment.<br><br>It
is another object of this invention to provide a tennis training
simulation system that improves both reaction time and ground stroke
techniques by providing both visual and real simulation of the service
of a tennis ball from the service line to the student awaiting the
tennis ball delivery.<br><br>It is yet another object of this invention
to provide a tennis training simulation system that improves both
reaction time and ground stroke techniques by providing actual delivery
of a tennis ball to a student, on the first bounce, over a simulated
net.<br><br>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>The above and related
objects are achieved by providing a tennis training simulation system
that improves both reaction time and ground stroke techniques within a
limited physical training environment, by combining simulated service
of a tennis ball from a service line over a virtual net, and the
actual/real delivery of a real tennis ball to an awaiting tennis
student. In the system and method of this invention, the tennis ball
delivery system includes an automatic tennis ball machine equipped with
an array of lights or LED's that simulate the service of a tennis ball
from a service line, a simulated trajectory of the tennis ball over a
virtual net, a simulated first bounce to an awaiting tennis student,
and immediately thereafter, delivery of a real tennis ball, directly
from an automatic tennis ball machine, to the tennis student.<br><br>In
one of the preferred embodiments of this invention, the array of lights
or LED's on the tennis ball machine can be pre-programmed to a timed
sequence to simulate the speed of the simulated tennis service. Because
of the simulation of the service and ball trajectory from the service
line over the net, the tennis training simulation system of this
invention only requires a limited area in which to operate, and
generally, less than half of a the size of a tennis court. Accordingly,
the tennis training simulation system can be utilized in confined urban
environments, specifically, indoors and on private property residences
that are lacking tennis facilities.<br><br>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br>FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the tennis training simulation system of this invention;<br><br>FIG. 2A is a photographic depiction of a prototype incorporating the tennis training simulation system of this invention;<br><br>FIG. 2B an exploded view of the ball machine console of the tennis training simulation system depicted in FIGS. 1 &amp; 2A; and,<br><br>FIG. 3 is an isolated schematic of the tennis training simulation system in relation to the ball machine mechanism of FIG. 2.<br><br>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>The
Figures which accompany this application, and referenced herein, depict
representative assemblies of this invention. In the embodiments of this
invention illustrated in these FIGS, such FIGS include components in
common and thus, such common components are assigned the same reference
numerals for ease of understanding and continuity of explanation.<br><br>FIG.
1 depicts the tennis training simulation system in use in an
environment having limited area (e.g. two car garage). In the depiction
of the system of this invention illustrated in FIG. 1, the tennis
training simulation system comprises a ball machine console (10), and a
protective mesh or netting (12) between the console (10) and the tennis
student to protect the ball machine from the impact from a tennis ball
(14) resulting from a return volley by the student and to capture the
returned ball after impact by the student. A hole or vent (13) is
disposed within the net (12) to permit the ball (14) to be delivered to
the student. The ball machine console (10) includes a series or array
of lights or LED's (16) arranged on the forward facing panel (18) of
the console (10). Each of the individual lights or LED's in the array
(16) correspond to the simulation of an opponent's tennis service/hit
(16') and trajectory of the serve/hit over the net (16") from the
service line. More specifically, the first light (16') in the series of
the array of lights or LED's is simulative of the initiation of this
service sequence. Thereafter, a finite delay occurs before the second
in the series of the array of lights or LED's is illuminated. This
second light (16") in the series is simulative of the passage of the
ball over the net. Thereafter, a finite delay occurs before the third
light (16'") in the series of the array of lights or LED's is
illuminated. The last in the series of the lights or LED's (16'")
simulates the bounce of the service of the serve/hit on the tennis
trainee's side of the net, and corresponds with the ejection of a
tennis ball (14) from the ball console (10). The speed and flight of
the ball (14) from the console (10) is characteristic of a tennis ball
bounce on the receiving side of the net. The flight of the ball from
the ball machine can preferably be pre-programmed to correspond to
simulate different ball speeds and ball trajectory.<br><br>In the
embodiment of the invention depicted in FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B, the console
(10) includes a housing (30), a transparent feed tube (32) extending
vertically from the top of the console and a three light array (16) on
the forward panel (18) of the console which faces the tennis student.
The transparent feed tube (32) is filled with tennis balls (14) prior
to use; and, the tennis balls (14) thereafter automatically feed into
the console (10) where each is propelled, one at a time, by an impeller
mechanism (34) within the console, to an awaiting student. This gravity
feeding of the tennis balls from the feed tube (32) into a ball chute
(36) within the console, positions the most interior of the tennis
balls (14) proximate to the impeller mechanism (34). This impeller
mechanism (34) comprises a pair of synchronous, counter-rotating high
speed wheels (38, 38').<br><br>In practice, movement of a ball (14)
down the ball chute (36) is controlled by gating means (37) associated
with the chute. More specifically, once the system is turned on, after
a suitable delay, the timing mechanism causes the first of the lights
or LED's within the array to turn on simulating the serve. Thereafter,
the second of the lights or LED's with the array turns on simulating
the trajectory of the tennis ball over the net. Then, the third light
or LED turns on simulating the bounce of the ball on the student's side
of the net. Lastly, the gating means (37) releases the tennis ball (14)
to permit its gravity feeding from the ball chute (36) into the
impeller mechanism (34). As above noted, at each stage of this
simulation, a light or LED on the console is illuminated to alert the
tennis student as to the approximate virtual position of the tennis
ball before it is fed into the impeller mechanism.<br><br>As more fully
illustrated in FIGS. 2B and 3, the ball chute (36), angled from the
feed tube (32), feeds the tennis balls (14) forward from the vertical
feeder tube (32); and, the gating means (37) associated with the chute,
incrementally releases one ball at a time, for each simulation
sequence. The timing of the release of the balls at the end of the ball
chute is microprocessor controlled, and the duration of the interval
between each simulation sequence governed by a pre-programmed
simulation routine of the training system.<br><br>In the specific
embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 2B, switch (42) has a
lever (40) that either one or two tennis balls can keep depressed as
the balls drop. This switch (42), when depressed, allows the timing
sequence to operate, and also shuts down the timing sequence after all
balls are ejected. When the feed tube (32) is inserted onto the console
(10), balls (14) contained with the tube are gravity fed and are
retained by ball chute gate (43). When the start time switch (48) is
turned on, the sequence begins. The lights (16) are sequentially
illuminated as heretofore disclosed. Illumination of the first light
(16') informs the player to prepare to get into a hitting position. As
the third light (16'") is illuminated, the solenoid (44) is engaged.
The solenoid (44) withdraws the ball chute gate (43) of the gating
means (37) thereby releasing the bottom-most ball (14), and at the same
time, thrusts the ball impedance gate (43') into the chute thereby
preventing other balls from being released.<br><br>The released ball
trips switch (42') which breaks the circuit and starts the sequence
over. The tripped switch (42') also releases the solenoid (44),
allowing the ball chute gate (43) to be thrust into the chute and at
the same time causes the ball impedance gate to withdraw so that the
next ball (14) can advance to the ball chute gate (43) in preparation
for the next sequence. The counter-rotating wheels (38) of the impeller
(34) can be adjusted to deliver the tennis ball at different speeds
and/or when rotated asynchronously to put "English" or spin on the
projected ball to enhance the difficulty of its return of service.<br><br>FIG.
3 further isolates the mechanical levers (40, 40') and switches (42,
42') of the chute gate means (37), the timing circuitry (46), and the
impeller ensemble (34), which includes counter-rotating motors of the
impeller wheels, and rheostat speed control for the motors. In
operation, the console is turned on by activation of a start timer
switch (48) which, after a pre-programmed delay, initiates the sequence
of events which energizes the ball supply switch (42) along the ball
chute (36), and, initiates the process of the sequential illumination
of the lights in the array (16) on the forward panel (18) of the
console (10). Once the tennis ball (14) has been advanced down the
chute into the gate means (37), the system counts down for
ejection/delivery of a tennis ball from the ball chute with each of the
lights within the array illuminating, in turn. At the conclusion of
this sequence, a tennis ball is delivered from the ball chute to the
awaiting tennis student as if it had been served, traveled over the net
and bounced onto the receiving side of the net. The sequence repeated
so long as the tennis balls are supplied to the ball chute within the
console.<br><br>In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the
pre-programmed information permits variation in the timing and delivery
of the tennis ball from the ball machine console. The mechanism
depicted in FIGS. 2A and 2B can be further modified to permit
oscillation of the ball chute, and thereby both backhand and forehand
delivery of the tennis ball.<br><br>The invention as above described is
provided as illustrative of a number of the preferred embodiments of
this invention. Thus, this description is neither intended, nor should
it be construed as, to delineate the scope of this invention, which has
been reserved for the claims that follow.<br><br>* * * * *</div></td><td id="patent-right"><div class="konafilter"><div id="patdet"><p></p><h2>Inventors</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/inventors-patents/Paul_Parkinson/1495939/1.html">Parkinson, Paul</a></li><li><a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/inventors-patents/Peter_Daniel/1495940/1.html">Daniel, Peter</a></li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>Application</h2> No. 10180584 filed on 06/26/2002 <p></p><h2>US Classes:</h2><b><a class="htt" id="c473431000" href="http://www.patentstorm.us/class-patents/473/431/Having_projectile_return_means/1.html">473/431</a></b>, <span class="tt" id="tc473431000">Having projectile return means</span><a class="htt" id="c473459000" href="http://www.patentstorm.us/class-patents/473/459/For_game_using_field_or_court_having_dividing_means_thereon_for_separating_opponents__e_g___for_tennis__volleyball__table_tennis__etc__/1.html">473/459</a>, <span class="tt" id="tc473459000">For
